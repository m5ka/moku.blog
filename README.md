**moku.blog** is a small-web community for food enthusiasts.

## ü•ê behind the name
**moku** is the [toki pona](https://tokipona.org/) word for "food", "drink", "eat" or, really, anything to do with consuming. it comes from the japanese onomatopoeia [„ÇÇ„Åê„ÇÇ„Åê](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%82%82%E3%81%90%E3%82%82%E3%81%90#Japanese) (_mogu-mogu_) which represents the sound of chewing.

## üçï contributing
it's great that you want to help out! a good place to start is checking in [issues](https://github.com/m5ka/moku.blog/issues) to see if what you're thinking about has already been discussed.

### pre-requisites
* python 3.12 and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
* postgresql

### setting up the environment
the environment is all managed by poetry so it's pretty easy to get started once you have poetry set up.
```sh
poetry install --with dev,test
```

if you get an error about `psycopg2`, make sure you have the system package `libpq-dev` installed on your system.

### code-style
all our code is linted and formatted by [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) so it's important to make sure any changes you make are compliant.

```sh
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run ruff format --check .
```

if you want ruff to auto-format your code, you can use `poetry run ruff format .`
